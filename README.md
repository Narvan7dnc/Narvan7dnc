    proshippers, p3do people, people who just want to make an arguement in first chance, people who wanna talk about their problems 24/7 (i mean 24/7 fr, don't get me wrong i don't mind listening but being friends JUST to share those things? no.) 
   
   
 btw: joke normal cursed ships (example character x grass, not like two characters that should NOT be shipped) are okay as long it's joking 

    · i am a multifandom person, so i could say i 'literally' don't have a main fandom (but i have fav fandoms at least)
    
     · for some -reasons-, 'sometimes' i don't play ponytown everyday. /i might suddenly disappear after randomly saying "gtg"
    
    
  · Some of fandoms i am in: hannibal, Sth, sfh, totnt, bad&crazy, sg, omori, madfather, fnaf, dsaf, baldibasics, fpe, Minecraft, sky cotl, and so many else that i don't remember 💔
 

·i live in iran. yes a muslim but i QUITE respect to all religions. + i don't wear hijab and aren't like the other muslims you think and saw, so don't hit me with "isnt that/this stuff haram for yall?! why do you like gay people?!" (and idc if you're a muslim who is reading this and you say i'm not a muslim)


    · ima lazy artist lol (mostly draws on real paper)
    
- i dislike argues. so i always prefer to avoid it, specially when its over a simple stupid thing (i saw some people argue over a spot.)

  - aswell, im a girl irl, but most people call me by the pony' gender

 also, if you find me interesting, ... I N T! bro i'm kinda bad at talking 
   , but be comfortable! (i don't bite, trust me....)

  - C+h/sitting = friends can anytime i dont mind; if you're not a friend who wants to c+h/sit, ask first

  - int = anyone can anytime (literally) as long you're not in dni list, i dont mind it at all unless im in away mode (u still can w2i). i would probably answer whispers late or be afk if im on busy/away mode

 Also, thanks for reading! i yapped too much damn.
