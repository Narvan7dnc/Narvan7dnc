  * Well, there's some stuff about me

  · don't ask my age i'm not comfortable with it, but i'm a minor (not that young also lol) random but i respect every age as long the person is just alright mentally

    · i am a multifandom person, so i could say i literally don't have a main fandom
    
     · for some -reasons-, sometimes i don't play ponytown everyday. /i might suddenly disappear after randomly saying "gtg"
    
    · you can message me on tiktok (the link on bio) if you want to connect me !
    
  · Some of fandoms i am in: hannibal, Sth, sfh, totnt, bad&crazy, sg, omori, madfather, fnaf, dsaf, baldibasics, fpe,
      Minecraft, sky cotl, and so many else that i don't remember 💔

      · be comfortable talking about ships bc i'm fine with it! but not cursed ships/unless it's just kidding 

      · i live in iran. yes a muslim but i QUITE respect to all religions. + i don't wear hijab and aren't like the other muslims you think and saw so dont hit me with -isnt that/this stuff haram for yall?!-

    · ima lazy artist lol (mostly draws on real paper)
    
- i dislike argues. so i always prefer to avoid it, specially when its over a simple stupid thing (i saw some people argue over a spot.)

  - aswell, im a girl irl, but most people call me by the pony' gender

 also, if you find me interesting, ... I N T! bro i'm kinda bad at talking 
   , but be comfortable! (i don't bite, trust me....)

  - C+h/(prefers sitting beside) = friends can anytime i dont mind, if youre not a friend who wants to c+h/sit, ask first

  - int = anyone can anytime (literally), i dont mind it at all unless im in away mode (u still can w2i). i would probably answer whispers late or be afk if im on busy/away mode

 Also, thanks for reading! i yapped too much damn


-random facts, you can bark.
